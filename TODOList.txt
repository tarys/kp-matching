+ create dummy class and test
+ implement basic image loading
+ implement generative transforms constructing
+ implement correlant calculating and test(!) it
+ create TODO sublist inside KunchenkoRecognizer as dummy stubs for future implementation
+ implement basic algorithm stages
+ correlants caching to avoid redundant calculations
+ refactor all to extract abstract template method for KP-algorithm
+ move correlants calucation logic from GeneratedFunctionsSystem to CorrelantCalculator
+ implement 2D approximation just to ensure that it works
+ implement iterator over 2D signal and polynomial
- make all iterators' methods static (which is equivalent to stateless)
- refactor them to separate functions
- test functional version on Scilab
- create image tests
- optimize performance of algorhitm
